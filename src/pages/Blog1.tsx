        <h2 className="mb-4 text-3xl font-bold text-brand">Natural Language Processing for Resume Analysis</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">Gone are the days of manually scanning through hundreds of resumes. NLP technology now rips through thousands of applications in minutes, picking up on key qualifications you'd never spot at a glance.</p>
        <p className="mb-6">The magic happens when algorithms start understanding context, not just keywords. Modern NLP systems don't just match "Python developer" in a job description to "Python developer" on a resume. They get that "built scalable web applications using Django" means the candidate has Python skills—even if they never explicitly listed it.</p>
        <p className="mb-6">Companies like IBM and Google have slashed their time-to-hire by up to 70% using these tools. But the real game-changer? These systems learn from your hiring patterns. They start recognizing which experience markers actually predict success at your company.</p>
        <h2 className="mb-4 text-3xl font-bold text-brand">Machine Learning Algorithms for Candidate Matching</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">Think of ML algorithms as matchmakers on steroids. They're connecting candidates to positions based on success patterns your human recruiters might miss.</p>
        <p className="mb-6">These systems analyze thousands of data points—work history, skills, education, even communication style—and compare them against your top performers. LinkedIn's Recruiter platform uses this tech to surface candidates who might not exactly match your search terms but have the right skill profile.</p>
        <p className="mb-6">The coolest part? These systems get smarter over time. They track which candidates succeed after hiring and refine their matching criteria. Unilever saw their candidate quality scores jump 16% after implementing ML matching.</p>
        <h2 className="mb-4 text-3xl font-bold text-brand">Video Interview Analysis Tools</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">Video analysis takes interviewing to a whole new level. These tools assess candidates' facial expressions, word choice, and even speaking patterns during recorded interviews.</p>
        <ul className="mb-6">
          <li className="flex items-start mb-2"><span className="mr-2 flex-shrink-0"><svg width="20" height="20" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 20 20"><circle cx="10" cy="10" r="10" fill="#6366F1"/><path d="M6 10l3 3 5-5" stroke="#fff" strokeWidth="2" strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round"/></svg></span>Speech pattern analysis to measure confidence</li>
          <li className="flex items-start mb-2"><span className="mr-2 flex-shrink-0"><svg width="20" height="20" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 20 20"><circle cx="10" cy="10" r="10" fill="#6366F1"/><path d="M6 10l3 3 5-5" stroke="#fff" strokeWidth="2" strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round"/></svg></span>Micro-expression reading to gauge authenticity</li>
          <li className="flex items-start mb-2"><span className="mr-2 flex-shrink-0"><svg width="20" height="20" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 20 20"><circle cx="10" cy="10" r="10" fill="#6366F1"/><path d="M6 10l3 3 5-5" stroke="#fff" strokeWidth="2" strokeLinecap="round" strokeLinejoin="round"/></svg></span>Language analysis to evaluate problem-solving skills</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-6">Some companies report 90% reduction in hiring biases with these tools. They're structured, consistent, and evaluate every candidate against the same benchmarks.</p>
        <h2 className="mb-4 text-3xl font-bold text-brand">Chatbots and Candidate Engagement</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">Chatbots are transforming the candidate experience from ghosting to instant gratification. Imagine applying for a job at 11 PM and immediately getting personalized responses about your application status or answers to your questions about the role. That's what today's AI recruitment chatbots deliver.</p>
        <p className="mb-6">Companies like Marriott use chatbots that can schedule interviews, answer FAQs, and even give candidates feedback on their applications. The best part? Candidates love them. Satisfaction scores jump when applicants get immediate responses instead of radio silence.</p>
        <p className="mb-6">These systems also collect valuable data about candidate questions and concerns, helping companies refine their employer branding and recruitment process.</p>
